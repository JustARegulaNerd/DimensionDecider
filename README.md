# DimensionDecider
For Minecraft 20w14âˆž (infinite), decides a random dimension for you to go to.

# Compiling and running
To compile it, make sure you have at least JDK 5. Then, with your paths set up correctly, simply run `javac DimensionDecider.java` to compile it.

To run it, simply run `java DimensionDecider` and it'll work.

Alternatively, there's a pre-compiled JAR in the Releases section that I compiled in JDK 11 in Eclipse.
